# What is the Output?

In this Challenge, you have to guess the Output of a
specific part of Code.

For example:
int i = 1;
print(i);

What is the Output?
a. i
b. 1
c. int
d. something else (comment)


Then you'd have to say b, because that's the correct answer.
The point of this Challenge is, that you learn Code and
Programmatic Thinking trough Challenges.
